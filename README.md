# [Google-Homepage](https://bitaashna.github.io/Google-Homepage/)
Google Homepage clone created with HTML5 and CSS3.

Fixed a lot of positioning issue and Learned a lot about flexbox by creating this page. I decided to nest flexbox, so the entire page is a flex container and the three main elements (header, main and footer) are all a flex item & a flex container. This allowed me to use the "easy" formatting capabilities of flexbox to place the different elements.


# Todo
1. Add a basic JS toggle Apps Menu.

2. Add Dark mode with basic JS code
